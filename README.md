## Description 

This application is way for the user to keep track of employees in a company and display them in a modern way. It uses Node.js to prompt the user with questions about employees and then exports an html to the output folder.

## Installation
1. [Clone Repository](https://github.com/moagermo/Team-Profile)

2. Install packages
    * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
    * Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.

3. Open Terminal

4. Start app with "node index.js"


## Usage & Testing

When you first use node.js (node index.js), you will be prompted with questions regarding the employee you're entering first. After that employee has been entered, you will have the option to add another employee. Once all employees have been entered, you can choose "No" and the app will create a web page using HTML & Bootstrap. This will list all the employees that you previously entered. 

I have attached a screenshot of the final page submitted from the walkthrough video as well as the walkthrough video itself showing functionality, testing & the final html page.
